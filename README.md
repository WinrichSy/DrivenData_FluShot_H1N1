---
## Description
A classification model made using data from a phone survey with a sample of over 26 thousand respondents that were asked several questions regarding H1N1 and the seasonal flu. Diving into what type of categories, such as age, knowledge, and concern lead to a higher correlation with receiving an H1N1 vaccine.

## Background & Motivation
Vaccines for H1N1 were first publicly available in the United States in Oct 2009, when the US government began a vaccination campaign. We will look at data from the Nation 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey collected to monitor vaccination rates during that campaign.

With no current vaccine for COVID-19, I wanted to dive deeper into the previous pandemic and understand the vaccination rates during that. Looking into respondents' personal information and opinion and behaviors towards H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal flu might give us a better understanding and help further health campaigns. This phone survey asked people whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with information they shared about their lives, opinions, and behaviors.
